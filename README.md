## 🚀 INSTALLATION & RUNNING GUIDE

### System Requirements:

- **Visual Studio 2019 / 2022** (with the _.NET desktop development_ workload installed).
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (version 2016 or later, or SQL Express) and **SSMS**.

### Steps:

1. **Clone / Download the project**:

   ```bash
   git clone <TEAM_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

2. **Open the project**:
   - Open `QL_CuaHangBanThuocTruSau.sln` in Visual Studio.

3. **Configure the database connection**:
   - Open `App.config`.
   - Update the `connectionString` to match your SQL Server:
     ```xml
     <connectionStrings>
       <add name="QL_ThuocTruSauDbContext"
            connectionString="Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=QL_ThuocTruSauDB;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
            providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
     </connectionStrings>
     ```

4. **Update the database (Entity Framework Migration)**:
   - Open the **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio (`Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console`).
   - Run the database update command:

## 📧 EMAIL VERIFICATION CONFIGURATION (EMAILHELPER)

For **password recovery / OTP verification by email** to work, configure the sending email account in `EmailHelper.cs`.

### 📂 File location:

[`QL_thuoctrusau/Utils/EmailHelper.cs`]

### ⚙️ Email configuration steps:

1. Open [`Utils/EmailHelper.cs`].
2. Change the values of the `FromEmail` and `AppPassword` constants:

```csharp
namespace QL_CuaHangBanThuocTruSau.Utils
{
    public static class EmailHelper
    {
        private const string Host = "smtp.gmail.com";
        private const int Port = 587;

      // 🟢 Replace with your Gmail sending address
      private const string FromEmail = "your-sending-email@gmail.com";

      // 🟢 Replace with the 16-character App Password generated by Google
        private const string AppPassword = "xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx";

        // ...
    }
}
```

### 🔑 How to get a Gmail App Password:

1. Go to your Google account at [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Select **Security** and make sure **2-Step Verification** is enabled.
3. Search for **App Passwords**.
4. Create a new app name (for example, `QL_ThuocTruSau`).
5. Google will generate a **16-character** password.
6. Copy the password and paste it into the `AppPassword` constant in `EmailHelper.cs`.

> ⚠️ **Important**: Do not use your regular personal Gmail password. You must use a Google **App Password** so email delivery is not blocked by Gmail security controls.
